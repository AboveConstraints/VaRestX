> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a fork of the original VaRest from ufna which we loved and used widely in our projects, unfortuntaly the support has come to an end, and projects still use it over the http blueprint plugin provided by epic, which could be less advanced and curated than this, we have decided to fork this project and bring it back for Unreal Engine 5.5, however we ask the help of the entire community to keep it up to date and improve it with pull requests as we don't assure you any improvements or new features.

> Feel free to use the existing code as a foundation for your own projects.
